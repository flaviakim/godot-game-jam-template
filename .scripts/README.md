# .Scripts folder

If you are not a programmer you can probably ignore this folder if the programmer you trust did not leas you here.

It contains .sh or bash scripts which automate some tasks.

Example:

- run_web_build.sh : can be used to run the lates webbuild locally (requires an installed phyton runtime)
