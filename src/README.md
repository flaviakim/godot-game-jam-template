# What files to put here

files which have to be edited within godot or an other code editor

- all godot releated files

Please try to keep the deepth of the folder structur shallow so that it is easy to navigate.

I propose:

```
src
    |-main
    |   |-main.tscn -> main entry point of the game
    |    L> ... other global files which are used in all scenes
    |-game
    |   |-game.tscn -> global game scene which is the base of all game scenes
    |   |-game.gd -> script which is attached to the root node of the game.tscn
    |   |-objects
    |   |   |-player/...
    |   |   |-coins/...
    |   |   |-> ... subfolders for each game related object e.g. player
    |   |-levels (for level definitions, level layouts if we ar going to have levels...)
    |   |   |->level1
    |   |   |->level2
    |   |   |->...
    |-mainmenu
    |-... other e.g. settings menus
    |-ui -> folder for global ui elements which can be used everywhere
```
